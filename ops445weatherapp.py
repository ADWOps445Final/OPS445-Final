 Capstone Project: Weather Forecast Application
 Course: OPS445
 Section: NDD
 Professor M. Rebultan
 Created By: Angelo Maroulis, Desinthan Paranthaman, Waleed Arif

 The purpose of the Weather Forecast Application is to create a simple but intuitive
 interface that will allow the end-user to interact. The end-user will be able to 
 input a location and receive the weather of the location. To receive real-time 
 weather data, the code will implement an API Key from OpenWeatherMap. OpenWeatherMap
 is a service which provides real-time data of the weather. Using the API Key, an 
 HTTP request is sent with the location provided by the end-user to OpenWeatherMap Server.
 The server will return a reply with information of the weather of the specified location.

""" 
 The following packages and modules (tkinter, configparser, PIL)  are used to provide the toolset 
 needed to develop the interface of the Weather Forecast Application. The module requests is used
 to send an HTTP request, with the API Key, for the weather of a location. The module datetime
 is used to determine the current time of where the end-user is located.

The purpose of the function get_weather is to create and send the HTTP request for the weather

 is made, a reply is sent from OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the data. The function then processes
 the data from the reply, and retrives the relevant data regarding the weather of the location. 
 The data is then stored into variables to be used for the variables.

 The function get_background_image is used to determine the background image for the interface.

 The function search is used to retrieve the location from the end-user. The input is stored in
 a variable which is then called in a variable weather. The weather variable calls the get_weather
 function using the city variable as the parameter. If the weather data is  able to be retrieved
 from OpenWeatherMap, the information is displayed on the interface along with the mataching
 images which correspond with the weather. However, if the weather data can not be retrieved 
 it is because the location provided by the end-user does not exist. A message is displayed on the
 interface telling the end-user the location provided could not be found.
